-[SEMANTIC ELEMENTS]
semantic elements play a crucial role in making a web content accessible to all users, icluding those using assistive technologies such as screen readers.It also helps the search engine and other automated tools understand the structure and meaning of your content.
Here are some key sementic elements we used for this project.
- <header><\header>: Represents introductory content at the beginning of a section or webpage.
- <nav></nav>: Defines a section of navigation links.
- <section></section>: Represents a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.
[Logical Structure of HTML]
-This means that the order and hierarchy of elements make sense even without the presence of styling. This helps users navigate and understand the content more easily.
 -Here are some key consideration for maintaining a logical structure;
  **Top-down structure: Arrange your HTML elements in a top-down structure where the most important content come first. This helps users quickly grasp the main point of the page.
  **Nested Elements: use nesting appropriately to reflect the hierarchy of content. for example,place subsections within <section> elements and related content within <article> elements.
  **Proper Use Headings:Use heading elements to establish a clear hierarchy of content.headings should be used to outline the main sections of the page and should follow a sequential order.
   **Avoiding Divitis: Minimize the use of generic <div> elements for layout purposes only. Insteat use semantic elements that convey meaning and structure to the content.
   [Accessible alt attributes for images] alt attributes provides alternative text descriptions for images,making them accessible to users who may have visual impairments or use assistive technologies like screen readers.
   [Concise and Descriptive Title Elements]
    verify that the title element of the webpage is concise and descriptive. The title should accurately summarize the content of the page and provide users with a clear understanding of what to expect.
